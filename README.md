# Web AI coding challenge

## Front-end stack

React, styled-components, motion, react-grid-system, react-three-fiber. Especially, motion is powerful to implement scroll-based animations. React-grid-system is used to achieve 12 column responsive flexbox system. r3f for the 3D image gallery.

## Process

Concepting -> Front-end architecture → Scaffold responsive 12-column layout → Build basic sections/components → Implement micro-animation for hero copy → Ideate/research interactions for images → Build 3D image gallery → Fine-tune detailed motions

## Trade-offs

Due to time constraints, accessibility (a11y) was not included in the scope. For example, image captions and descriptive text for the 3D scene were omitted.
